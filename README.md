# ReScript Select

Rescript select example.
I used react-select and emotion for styling my components, but for style children components of react-select I used prop `~prefixClassName` and simple css. I tried to bind style funicton to style it with emotion, but I haven't enough expirience to solve this problem by myself wright now.

## Used packages

- flag-icons - from task recommendation
- react-select - from task recommendation
- react-window - for virtualization list of options
- @emotion/css for styling
- @ryyppy/rescript-promise, it was recommended in doc https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/promise#promise-new

## Local start

`npm run start` - for rescript builds
`npm run webstart` - for webpack serve
